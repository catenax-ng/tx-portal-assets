<br>

#### #2 Fork setup

Setup your fork by entering a name and make sure that you unselect the "main branch only" selection (in case the original repo has a dev and a main branch).

<br>

Click "Create fork"

<br>

#### #3 Commit

With the newly created fork, you can now start to contribute. Create a new branch in your own fork and start to implement the planned changes/develop new features.
When the changes/new developments are done, create a pr against the original repository.

<br>

The pr will get validated / reviewed by the repo owners/official committers.
As part of the pr review, sonar cloud will run automatically, and unit tests (if configured) will get executed. The PR owner is responsible to check the results and fix possible findings.

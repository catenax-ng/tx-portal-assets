## FAQ

### How to register a connector inside the network?
A connector can get created via the user navigation "Connector Registration".
<br>
The sub-menu is only available for company administrators.
<br>
<br>
The connector registration will auto generate the connector self-description and the daps authentication.
<br>

<br>
<br>
In the following window, select the connector type. Either "Company Connector" (own Connector) or "Connector-as-a-service" (managed Connector).
<br>

<br>
<br>
After selecting the connector and pressing "confirm" the connector form gets displayed where connector details as well as the authentication key (public key) needs to get added.
The public key is needed for the connector authentication inside the dataspace. Details to the connector authentication can get found HERE (to be added asap).
<br>
<br>
With the successful registration, the connector is part of the dataspace. This means, the connector can get identified by other dataspace participants, as well as authentication is secured.
<br>
<br>

### Whats the difference of a OWNED and a MANAGED connector?
Owned connectors are company (own managed) connectors.
Managed connectors are (3rd party managed) connectors, e.g. if a connector is managed by a service provider.
<br>
<br>

### How can a connector get deleted?
The deletion of a connector is similar as the registration only possible if the user has enough user permissions. Ideally the company administrator or IT admin.
To delete a connector registered inside the network, get to the connector overview and trigger the deletion via the delete icon.
<br><img width="54" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/210186617-d6d83c01-04eb-4ca6-8901-f848cd6975ea.png">
<br>
With the successful deletion, the daps registration will get disabled and the connector wont be available in the dataspace anymore.
<br>
<br>

### Why is my connector "PENDING"?
A pending connector status shows, that the connector is not fully registered inside the dataspace yet. For example: the daps authentication might be missing or the connector provider still needs to configure the connector before the connector is fully usable.
In case of a managed connector - please contact for any questions your service provider.
<br>
<br>

### Why is my connector authentication icon green or grey?
The connector authentication icon shows the authentication status. If the icon is grey, the authentication was unsuccessful; in this case a new authentication needs to get manually triggered. Otherwise the connector will be not useable inside the dataspace.
A green connector icon shows the active authentication registration.
<br>
<br>


### Whats a public key and how do I create the public key?
Self-Signed certificates (with the public key) are relevant to crate a secure authentication between my connector and the catena-x dataspace.
Therefore the own created public key needs to get created by the connector owner and shared with the CX dataspace authentication system.  
<br>
To create the public key, please follow the steps defined below:
* Install OpenSSL or LibreSSL (509.X Zertifikat)
* Create the keys with the following data
 * Make sure you have your BPN and Legal Entity data of the connector owner (not the host) available
 * URL of the connector

#### Steps to install OpenSSL on mac with brew:</summary>
  
  ##### Step 1: Install brew

     * Open terminal on your Mac
     * Enter the command:
       /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     * Reference link: https://brew.sh/

<br>

  ##### Step 2:  Add Homebrew to your path and install openssl

    Run these three commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    
     * echo '# Set PATH, MANPATH, etc., for Homebrew.' >> /Users/ $USER/.zprofile
     * echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/ $USER/.zprofile
     * eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"


  Then run brew update and install:
     * brew update
     * brew install openssl

<br>

  ##### Step 3:  Navigate to the folder having openssl.cnf and run the command

<br>
<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/213122903-3b58c120-4e12-44a0-8bfb-7be2ec661768.png">

<br>
<br>

#### Steps to install OpenSSL on windows:</summary>
  
  ##### Step 1:  
  Install OpenSSL. For example using Cygwin client. https://www.cygwin.com/install.html.
  Select setup-x86_64.exe file and download it. 

<br>
<img width="684" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/222188381-8d52eac1-17cc-499a-88f2-3111de970bd0.png">
<br>

During installation you can select some options or you can leave it all as default.

  ##### Step 2:  
  When installation is done, launch Cygwin and use instruction below for creating self-sign certificate. Do not forget that you need to download and place openssl.cnf file in directory where you want to run openssl command.

With that, you are all set.

<br>
<br>

The attached openssl.cnf shall be used as a configuration file for openssl in order to generate correct certificate. The certificate shall include SKI and AKI extensions.

Assuming the openssl.cnf is located in current directory a requestor shall execute this code and answer the questions the tool asks:

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -text -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt -config openssl.cnf

<br>
<br>

[openssl.txt](https://github.com/catenax-ng/tx-portal-assets/files/10862803/openssl.txt)
(please download the file and store it as cnf file before using it)

<br>
<br>

Here private.key is the private key and certificate.crt is a certificate you should use for the registration. These files are generated by the tool and are placed to the directory where you run oppenssl from. 

Please use the Portal to register your Connectors.

The connector shall be configured to use generated keys, the DAPS server shall be set to the https://daps.beta.demo.catena-x.net

Then wait for confirmation from our side.

### Connector Configuration for authentication flow

Your edc instance need to get connected to the catena-x identity provider for the technical user authentication flow to fetch the user token and authenticate against the MIW. Additionally the MIW endpoint, authority BPN and your technical user need to get configured/set to ensure that the connection works correctly.

Below you can find the relevant details regarding all those values

      * central auth url: https://centralidp.{env}.demo.catena-x.net/auth/realms/CX-Central/protocol/openid-connect/token  (please note: this is an example url only and might differ depending on the party running the cor applications)

      * client id:
        {client id of your existing or newly created tech user - details how to: [https://portal.int.demo.catena-x.net/documentation/?path=docs%2F03.+User+Management%2F03.+Technical+User%2F02.+Create+Technical+User.md]}
      * client secret:
        {client id of your existing or newly created tech user - details how to: [https://portal.int.demo.catena-x.net/documentation/?path=docs%2F03.+User+Management%2F03.+Technical+User%2F02.+Create+Technical+User.md]}
      * authority bpn: BPNL00000003CRHK (need to get fetched from the endpoint GET: /api/administration/staticdata/operator-bpn)
      * miw url: https://managed-identity-wallets-new.{env}.demo.catena-x.net/
